    "## Question 1: Siamese networks & one-shot learning (8pt)\n",
    "The Cifar-100 dataset is similar to the Cifar-10 dataset. It also consists of 60,000 32x32 RGB images, but they are distributed over 100 classes instead of 10. Thus, each class has much less examples, only 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. For more info about the dataset, see https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "*HINT: Import the Cifar-100 dataset directly from Keras, no need to download it from the website. Use* `label_mode=\"fine\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1.1: Siamese network\n",
    "**a)**\n",
    "* Train a Siamese Network on the first 80 classes of (the training set of) Cifar-100, i.e. let the network predict the probability that two input images are from the same class. Use 1 as a target for pairs of images from the same class (positive pairs), and 0 for pairs of images from different classes (negative pairs). Randomly select image pairs from Cifar-100, but make sure you train on as many positive pairs as negative pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluate the performance of the network on 20-way one-shot learning tasks. Do this by generating 250 random tasks and obtain the average accuracy for each evaluation round. Use the remaining 20 classes that were not used for training. The model should perform better than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question you may ignore the test set of Cifar-100; it suffices to use only the training set and split this, using the first 80 classes for training and the remaining 20 classes for one-shot testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*HINT: First sort the data by their labels (see e.g.* `numpy.argsort()`*), then reshape the data to a shape of* `(n_classes, n_examples, width, height, depth)`*, similar to the Omniglot data in Practical 4. It is then easier to split the data by class, and to sample positive and negative images pairs for training the Siamese network.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE: do not expect the one-shot accuracy for Cifar-100 to be similar to that accuracy for Omniglot; a lower accuracy can be expected. However, accuracy higher than random guess is certainly achievable.*"
